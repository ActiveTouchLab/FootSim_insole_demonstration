# FootSim_insole_demonstration
## Code and data used to simulate tactile responses to steps in "Modelling foot sole cutaneous afferents (FootSim)" (Katic et al., under review, iScience)

The code used within this mini-repository builds upon that in FootSim (https://github.com/ActiveTouchLab/footsim-python) to simulate tactile responses to walking

The data used within this simulations is part of a larger project, titled "Complexity of spatiotemporal plantar pressure patterns during everyday behaviours" (Cleland et al., in prep.). Further data and code related to this project can be found at https://github.com/LClel/project_insole.

### This repository contains:
* /data - raw data files
* /processed_data - processed data that can be loaded in to generate only the figures
* /code - the code used to generate figures
* /figures - figures generated using the code
